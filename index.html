            <h2 id="Breon">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am beyond committed to my passions and my goals. I was born and raised in Hampton Roads, Va. I lived and attended school in Virginia Beach for most of my life.
               Much of my family served in the military, my father being one of those individuals. My grandfather on my mother's side as well. These are the men I looked up to.
               I mostly lived in low-income areas where it is easy to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Through those odss I did my best to make the right decisions.
               I tried my hand in sports even though it was hard to stay fouced on my own. My mother worked day and night to make ends meet.
               My father was around for my youth but my parents were divorced by the time I was 5 years old. He didn't show much interest in my extracaricular activities.
               I was always fueled by my own determination to be better. Which led me to starting school for computer information science. This decision was also influenced by my father
               making a decision to change his career path to technology. I also was highly involved in mixed martial arts. I worked hard to accel towards a professional career.
               Which is how I ended up in Phoenix, AZ. I advanced in MMA and started working in the Fitness Industry. 
               I loved my job and the gratification that came with it. I was helping people change their lives. Everyday I got to impact numerous lives. 
               I quickly advanced into management, running several high-value facilties across the valley.
               The day to day responsibilities, including administrative duties, propelled me towards wanting to grow more. I am eager to impact more lives.
               Fast forward to today and I am seeking to grow my technology based skill set to do just that. I have many ideas and believe I have the interest and intellect to do just that.
               My dedication and work ethic is astounding. I have a level of discipline that drives me even when I am not motivated.
               This drive was built from a young age with my athletics and fitness. It has poured over into all aspects of my life.
               I have broken state powerlifting records and am striving to break national and world records. I plan to use this same discipline and drive to excel as a developer.
               I look forward to the journey I have chosen to embark on. I will be learning and growing daily. I will stack skills on top of one another, extending my range of application and knowledge base.
